# Snowflake SQL Portfolio

This project goes over the Snowflake table structure and includes sample SQL queries that apply these concepts to real-world use cases.

# Intro

I am using this sample dataset from IMDB (first 5 rows): 

| id   | titleType |                                primaryTitle                   |                   originalTitle | isAdult | startYear | endYear | runtimeMinutes|                   genres |
| ---- | --------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1    | short     |                              Carmencita     |                                    Carmencita  |    No   |   1894  |  None     |         1 |        Documentary,Short |

| 4    | short     |                             Un bon bock      |                                  Un bon bock  |    No   |   1892  |  None      |       12 |          Animation,Short |  
| 5    | short     |                        Blacksmith Scene     |                              Blacksmith Scene   |   No   |   1893  |  None      |        1 |                    Short |

Each folder includes details on my understanding of specific Snowflake table structure concepts and how I'd apply them to this data in order to reflect how I would treat a real-world situation.
